    category: 'Installation',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need permission to install solar panels on my roof?',
    answer:
      "For most residential installations in Nigeria, you don't need special permits for rooftop solar. However, for grid-tied systems, you'll need approval from your electricity distribution company (DISCO). Commercial installations may require building permits. ACOB Lighting handles all necessary paperwork and approvals.",
    category: 'Installation',
  },
  {
    question: 'What type of roof is best for solar panels?',
    answer:
      'Solar panels can be installed on most roof types including metal sheets, concrete slabs, and tiles. The key requirements are: structurally sound roof that can support the weight (typically 15-20 kg per panel), minimal shading, and sufficient space. South-facing roofs with 10-30° tilt are optimal in Nigeria, but east-west orientations also work well.',
    category: 'Installation',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can solar panels be installed on the ground?',
    answer:
      'Yes, ground-mounted systems are an excellent alternative when roofs are unsuitable.

    category: 'Cost & Savings',
  },

  // System Performance
  {
    question: 'Will solar panels work on cloudy days?',
    answer:
      "Yes, solar panels still generate electricity on cloudy days, though at reduced capacity (typically 10-25% of peak output). Nigeria's tropical climate provides strong sunlight most of the year. Even on overcast days, diffused sunlight produces usable power. Battery storage systems ensure continuous power supply regardless of weather.",
    category: 'System Performance',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much electricity can a solar panel generate?',
    answer:
      "In Nigeria's climate, a 550W solar panel typically generates 2.0-2.5 kWh per day (depending on location and season). A 5kW system (9 panels) produces about 18-22 kWh daily, enough for an average household. Performance varies by: panel orientation, shading, dust accumulation, and temperature.",
    category: 'System Performance',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens during power outages?',
    answer:
      'If you have a hybrid system with battery storage, your solar system continues providing power during grid outages seamlessly. The system automatically switches to battery power within milliseconds. Without batteries, grid-tied systems automatically shut down during outages for safety reasons (to protect utility workers).',
    category: 'System Performance',
  },
